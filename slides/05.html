<h3 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h3>
<p>Some features I plan to add:</p>
<ul>
<li>Load in a gihub gist and display is as a slide show</li>
<li>Make the url let you navigate to slide number and slide title</li>
<li>Make the animation a little less buggy for scroll wheel</li>
<li>Probably throw everything out and start over with fewer dependencies  </li>
</ul>
